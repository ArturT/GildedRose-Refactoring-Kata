# Ruby solution for Gilded Rose Kata

Set up:

    $ bundle install
    $ guard

Run tests:

    $ rspec spec/gilded_rose_spec.rb

You can edit `require` line at the top of `spec/gilded_rose_spec.rb` to load proper GildedRose class like:

* `gilded_rose.rb` - not refactored code, your starting point :)
* `gilded_rose_refactored_1.rb` - just example with first refactored code and implemented Conjured item, it's still not good enough
* `gilded_rose_refactored_2.rb` - second example of refactored code, it has a lot of extracted small objects

__Use as your starting point the `gilded_rose.rb` and ensure you run spec for it (see `require` at the top of spec file). Don't look at refactored examples - try it yourself first.__
